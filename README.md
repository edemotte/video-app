Hey, Thanks for popping by to my Movie Sharing app :)

What I am attempting to achieve is to create an app which works in a similar way to Netflix.

I have used:

- React Js on the front-end,
- Firebase to deploy,
- Axios for handling api requests

I followed the steps below to to have a kind of a workflow

1. Created a fresh React projects
2. Created an account on TMDB and got the API key
3. Set-up Firebase hosting
4. Get ALL MOVIES from API
5. Built Rows (as a component)
6. Built the banner
